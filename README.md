# Credit Risk Analysis
---

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use credit data from a lending service company, LendingClub, to predict credit risk. The outcome of this analysis is meant to assist lending service companies improve their loan application processes by implementing machine learning and identifying optimal loan candidates. Various sampling methods and machine learning models were used to perform analyses on the credit data, including:

- Random Oversampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Cluster Centroid Undersampling
- SMOTEENN (Over and Under) Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifying
- Easy Ensemble Classifying
